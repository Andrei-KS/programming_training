/*
* Run a small timing experiment to compare the cost of using vector and list.
* You can find an explanation of how to time a program in ยง26.6.1. Generate
* N random int values in the range [0:N ). As each int is generated, insert
* it into a vector<int> (which grows by one element each time). Keep the
* vector sorted; that is, a value is inserted after every previous value that is
* less than or equal to the new value and before every previous value that is
* larger than the new value. Now do the same experiment using a list<int> to
* hold the ints. For which N is the list faster than the vector? Try to explain
* your result. This experiment was first suggested by John Bentley
